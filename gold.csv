INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,,,"Silence.  Brian, Peter, and Lois wait for the flashback to come on.  Nothing."
INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,PETER,Damn this network.  Always screwing up our lives. How the hell are we going to tell our story if we can't even have one flashback? This is just like the time I started that petition to bring back Butt Ugly Martians. There's no flashback.,

INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,,,"An old man walks by with muddy shoes. The mud wipes onto the carpet. Suddenly, the man trips on his own feet, and his face hits the floor hard. His false teeth fly out of his mouth, transmitting gooey saliva all over the floor. Stewie gasps and becomes sickened."
INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,WOMAN #1,"Oh, that's disgusting!","She immediately hurls up her lunch. The vomit spreads across the floor, and another passing moviegoer slips in the puke. A young kid runs out of the bathroom with toilet paper attached to his shoe."

INT. THEATER AUDIENCE,PETER,I am so there.,
INT. THEATER AUDIENCE,,,"Stewie is on Lois's lap, fidgeting and fussing as he's terrified of the gross floor. Lois is becoming agitated as well."

INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,"Lois, it's that damn floor! It'll kill us all, I tell you! ALL OF US! It's a germ infested, noxious, contaminated killing machine! DON'T LET IT GET ME!",Stewie climbs on top of Lois's head.
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,LOIS,"That's it, Stewie! I told you to stop.",She pulls Stewie off of her head and sets him on the floor. Stewie howls in fear and disgust as his feet stick to the floor like a magnet on a fridge.

INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,Brian! Get off of the floor!,Stewie jumps onto a bench and quivers at the sight of the floor.
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,What for?,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,There's no time! I'll save you!,"Stewie jumps off of the bench and tackles Brian to the floor, smashing a potted plant to pieces as the vase breaks into tiny fragments. Stewie lifts Brian up from his collar and pulls him onto the bench. Stewie is out of breath and Brian is confused."
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,"Stewie, what the hell?",
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,"We're safe here. Not forever, but for now.",
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,What were we not safe from to begin with?,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,I'll show you.,Stewie leans over the bench and peers at the floor.
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,"There. Just below us. Frightening, isn't it?",
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,"Stewie, are you talking about the floor?",

INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,The carpet?,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,THEATER USHER,"I'm sorry, sir, but there's no dogs allowed in the theater. And every infant must have an adult with them over the age of 18.",A THEATER USHER approaches Brian and Stewie. The one that turned Meg away.
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,Over 18? I'm 49 years old!,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,THEATER USHER,And human.,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,You can't do that. I'm a paying customer.,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,THEATER USHER,"It's our policy, sir, and I can't bend the rules to satisfy what you think is right.",
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,"Why, you...","Brian lifts his fist. Suddenly, the floor begins shaking."
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,,,"AN EARTHQUAKE! The floor begins splitting and cracking. The ceiling wilts and tarnishes as broken beams fall to the floor. A beam falls on the THEATER USHER, knocking him unconscious."
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,BRIAN,OH MY GOD! IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE!,
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT,STEWIE,"IT'S THE FLOOR, I TELL YOU! THE FLOOR! IT'S HERE!!!",
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT,,,The movie playing on screen becomes loud as an action scene takes place. The movie theater begins to shake. The aisles split in half and the ceiling caves in.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT,LOIS,"LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! PETER, COME ON!",
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT,PETER,Wow. The sound here is incredible.,"Peter remains seated. The earthquake suddenly subsides. Everything goes quiet as the movie theater becomes empty, except for Peter. Silence. Peter remains still."

TELEVISION,TOM,"A sudden and unexpected earthquake struck Quahog just last night at eight o'clock. The first of its kind since the early 1970's. Seismologists have yet to figure out if there will be any other seismic waves to cause another earthquake in the area, but it's safe to say that we're all lucky it was only a 4.0 on the Richter scale.",
TELEVISION,DIANE,"That's right, Tom. The damage was moderate, but thank God nobody was seriously injured.",
INT. DILOPIDATED THEATER,,,The theater usher is still pinned under the broken beam that fell on him. Beams and broken pieces of wood continue to fall in the background as a result of the earthquake.
INT. DILOPIDATED THEATER,DARK MAN,Darth Vader. Rise.,"The man under the beam isn't the same. He's now dressed in a slick outfit with a handsome black cape. On his head is a dark helmet that projects his heavily breathing voice. This is the familiar Darth Vader from the STAR WARS movies. A beam suddenly falls on him, again. Darth Vader is no more."
INT. DILOPIDATED THEATER,DARK MAN,Now where the hell am I going to get someone to join the Dark Side...?,"The Dark Man laughs an evil laughter. A beam falls on him, too."
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DAY,,,Peter is still watching the news. Everyone else has left.
TELEVISION,DIANE,Now we go live to Trisha Takanawa with an in depth look at the damage caused by the horrible earthquake. Trisha?,
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,TRISHA,"Thank you, Diane. I'm here in Downtown Quahog where citizens of Rhode Island are joyous to still be living today. As you can see, the earthquake did quite a lot of damage to businesses and stores on this street, and there is a crack in the road wide enough to fit two copies of Chris Farley. (beat) Oh, I see a citizen roaming the area. Let's see if I can get a word with him. Sir!",
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,,,Trisha approaches a man. It's QUAGMIRE!
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,PETER,"Hey, Lois, look! Quagmire's on the tube!",
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,TRISHA,"Sir, can I have a word with you?",
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,QUAGMIRE,Sure thing. Maybe later we can do a brief featurette for the DVD. You. Me. Things falling into holes. OH!,
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,TRISHA,"Sir, what were you doing when the earthquake struck and how did you feel when it happened?",
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,QUAGMIRE,"Well I was having sex with some chick, and the bed started shaking, and I thought it was just some good pushin', but then the whole ceiling started caving in!",
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,TRISHA,And how did you feel?,
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,QUAGMIRE,Well things went from hot to cold pretty quick.  I finished up and she left.,
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY,TRISHA,Did you feel at all frightened during this experience?,

INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DAY,LOIS,"Peter, Chris never does his homework in his room.",
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DAY,PETER,What the big deal?  You should be proud.  The boy's studying at least.,
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DAY,LOIS,"I would be proud, Peter, but he never studies.  Period.  I'm gonna go up and see what he's doing.",
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DAY,PETER,"No, Lois.  I'll go.  I haven't talked to Chris in a while anyway. Oh man, this is gonna be more hilarious than that time I watched Jaws.",
INT. GRIFFIN LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK,PETER,RUN!!,Peter is watching Jaws on an exciting and tense underwater scene.
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,PETER,,Peter walks into Chris's bedroom and gasps.
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,,,Chris is making out with a girl!
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,PETER,Chris!,
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,,,Chris gasps and pushes his girlfriend out of the window.  The girl screams as her foot gets tangled up in the rope ladder hanging from it.
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,PETER,"Chris, who the hell was that?",
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,CHRIS,Nobody!,
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,PETER,"Chris, don't you lie to me!  I know a set of boobs when I see one!  Two boobs, I mean.  One set.",
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,CHRIS,Okay...,
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,,,Peter looks out of the window and sees the girl hanging from the rope ladder upside down.  Peter pulls the rope ladder up and the girl collapses onto Chris's bed. It's CONNIE DEMICO!
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,PETER,Connie Demico!?  Aren't you in Meg's class!?,
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,CONNIE,Yeah.  But-,
INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM,PETER,But you're the hottest piece of ass at Meg's school!  Why are you with Chris?,

INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE KITCHEN,CONNIE,It's really not a big deal.,
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE KITCHEN,MEG,May I be excused?,
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE KITCHEN,PETER,"Hell no you can't be excused! The chick that's tongue frenching your brother is the same one that picks on you at school!  Now you're not safe anywhere!  Man, talk about the irony!  And not that Alanis Morissette irony.  This is irony, irony.",
INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE KITCHEN,,,"LOIS, CHRIS, BRIAN, CONNIE, STEWIE, and MEG are presumably at the dining table (context from text)."
Dining Table,LOIS,"Chris, I'm so happy that you found someone to make you happy. And Connie, just so you know, Chris is hung like a mammoth.",
Dining Table,BRIAN,So. How long have you two been seeing each other? Is it strange being with each other knowing the age difference?,
Dining Table,CONNIE,"Look, we've only been together for about two weeks, and we never really thought about our age difference. It's the attraction that matters.",She holds Chris's right hand.
Dining Table,LOIS,And I'm more attracted to him than anybody else I've been with.,
Dining Table,STEWIE,"Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on. You're with Chris, but the attraction is what matters? Is that what you said? The attraction is what's important? And you're with Chris? Ok, just making sure.",
Dining Table,LOIS,"Meg, when are you gonna find a handsome boy at your school? Maybe that's the problem. You should try looking for a boyfriend at Chris's school. The popular girls are doing it.",
Dining Table,MEG,"Mom, you always told me to be my own person. I don't care what the popular kids are doing! I don't like any of this!",Meg flips over her plate against the wall and runs off crying.
Dining Table,LOIS,Meg! Get back here!,
Dining Table,PETER,"Don't worry, Lois. I set a trap on the stairs to stop her that's impossible to fail.",
INT. LIVING ROOM STAIRS,,Meg runs up the stairs. She sees a bear trap lying on one of the steps. She jumps over it. The stairs cave in. Meg falls inside. A piano rolls down the steps and falls inside the broken staircase hole. The piano crushes Meg.,

INT. GRIFFIN KITCHEN - DAY,BRIAN,You have connections?,
INT. GRIFFIN KITCHEN - DAY,PETER,"Well, sure! We would have never gotten into the movie theater last night if it weren't for me.",
INT. GRIFFIN KITCHEN - DAY,BRIAN,"Peter, you paid the usher. Any one of us could have done that.",
INT. GRIFFIN KITCHEN - DAY,PETER,"Yeah. Uh huh. Sure. Maybe you should look for a job and quit being jealous, Brian. You're making yourself look bad. He's usually an outside dog.",
INT. GRIFFIN KITCHEN - DAY,,,"Brian throws his plate against the wall and walks off, angry that Peter would him degrade him in such a harsh way."
INT. GRIFFIN KITCHEN - DAY,CONNIE,"Chris, let's go. I hear they're showing a special screening of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",

INT. KITCHEN - DAY,PETER,"SAY YOU WANT TO STUDY! DO IT, SON!",
INT. KITCHEN - DAY,CHRIS,"Dad, I don't think I'm comfortable with you commenting on me and Connie's relationship. You seem more enthused than I do. Come on, Connie. Let's go back up to my room.",
INT. KITCHEN - DAY,,,Chris and Connie dismiss themselves from the room.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY,PETER,"CHRIS, THERE'S A VIDEO CAMERA IN MY ROOM IF YOU GET LUCKY. ALRIGHT, SON? Alright.",

INT. JAMES WOODS MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY,CONNIE,"What's your problem, Meg? It's not like I'm doing it to you. You should be happy that I'm leaving you alone for once.",
INT. JAMES WOODS MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY,MEG,"No, this is a new low for you! You're messing with my family and that's not cool!",
INT. JAMES WOODS MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY,CONNIE,I think your family is messed up enough already.,
INT. JAMES WOODS MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY,MEG,"If you want to pick on me, whatever. But you leave my brother alone! Now I'm gonna have to be the one to tell him what you've done! And he's gonna be hurt from what I say, when you're the one that did it!",
INT. JAMES WOODS MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY,CONNIE,"You think he'll believe you? Meg, nobody listens to anything you say. Why would your brother be any different? He's obviously clueless.",
INT. JAMES WOODS MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY,MEG,"Connie, I've been wanting to do this for a long time. You've never ached me enough to do it, but this is the worst crap you've ever done, and I think you deserve it!",

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY,PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD,"Ok, Connie, your parents are on their way. Now Meg, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I am very upset that your daughter was the first to swing at Connie.
